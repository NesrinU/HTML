    <p>
    <i>DAY HAD <small>DAWNED</small> <del>COLD AND GRAY</del> WHEN the man turned aside from the main <b>Yukon</b> trail.</i>
      He climbed the high earth-bank where a little-traveled trail led  east through 
      the pine forest.<br> It was a high bank, and he paused to breathe
      at the top. He excused the act to himself by looking at his watch. It was
      <sup>nine</sup> o’clock in the morning. There was no sun or promise of sun, although
      there was not a cloud in the sky.<b> It was a <i>clear</i> day.</b> However, there
      seemed to be an indescribable darkness over the face of things. <br><br>It That was
      because the sun was absent from the sky. This fact did not <b>worry</b> the man.
      He was not alarmed by the lack of sun.<mark> It had been days since he had seen
      the sun.</mark>
    </p> 

    <p>
        The man looked along the way he had come.<br><br><br><br> The Yukon lay a mile wide and
        hidden under three feet of ice. On top of this ice were as many feet of
        snow. It was all pure white. <strong>North</strong> and south, as far as his eye could see,
        it was unbroken white. The one thing that relieved the whiteness was a
        thin dark line that curved from the pine-covered island to the south. It
        curved into the north, where it <em>disappeared</em> <i>behind</i> another pine-covered
        island. This dark line was the trail—the main trail. It led south 500
        miles to the <i>Chilcoot Pass</i>, and salt water. <ins>It led <mark>north 75 miles</mark> to
        Dawson</ins>, and still farther on to the north a thousand miles to Nulato, and
        finally to <small>St. Michael</small>, on <b><i>Bering Sea</i></b> , a thousand miles and half a
        thousand more.  
    </p>
    <p>
    <strong>But all this—the distant trail, no sun in the sky, the great cold, and the
        strangeness of it all—had no effect on the man.<ins> It was not because he was
        long familiar with it.</ins> He was a newcomer in the land, and this was his
        first winter.</strong>
